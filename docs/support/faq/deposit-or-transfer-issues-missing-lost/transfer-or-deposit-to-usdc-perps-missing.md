# Transfer or deposit to USDC (Perps) missing

Situation 1: Transferred 1,000 from USDC (Spot) to USDC (Perps). When I checked, I see <1,000 USDC in my Available Balance. Where did it go?

Situation 2: Deposited 1,000 USDC from Arbitrum, and the deposit was successful. When I checked, I see <1,000 USDC in my Available Balance. Where did it go?

### Reasoning

* If you have open positions on cross margin with negative unrealized P\&L, your deposits and Spot to Perp transfers will go toward collateral for those open positions.
