# Optimizing latency

Optimizing read latency (receiving market data):

1. Run a non-validating node against a reliable peer, such as Hyper Foundation non-validator.&#x20;
2. Run node with `--disable-output-file-buffering` to get outputs as soon as blocks are executed
3. Run node with sufficient machines specs, at least 32 logical cores, 128 GB RAM, and 500 MB/s disk throughput. Increasing cores can reduce latency because blocks will be faster to execute.
4. Construct book and other exchange state locally using outputs from node, which has faster and more granular data than the API. See <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server> for an example on how to build an order book on the same machine that is running a node.
5. `--batch-by-block` on the node will wait until the end of the block to write the data. The example order book server above uses this to simplify logic, but a further optimization could include turning the flag off and inferring block boundaries otherwise.
6. Read priority fees are the fastest way to read raw data from the network. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/priority-fees.md) for more details.&#x20;

Optimizing write latency (sending orders and cancels):

1. Write priority fees are the fastest way to read send transactions to the network. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/priority-fees.md) for more details.&#x20;
