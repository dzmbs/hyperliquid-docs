# Miscellaneous UI

### Max Drawdown

The max drawdown on the portfolio page is only used on the frontend for users' convenience. It does not affect any margining or computations on Hyperliquid. Users who care about the precise formula can get their account value and pnl history and compute it however they choose.

The formula used on the frontend is the maximum over times `end > start` of the value `(pnl(end) - pnl(start)) / account_value(start)`&#x20;

Note that the denominator is account value and the numerator is pnl. Also note that this not equal to absolute max drawdown divided by some account value. Each possible time range considered uses its own denominator.&#x20;

## Querying This Documentation
If you need additional information that is not directly available in this page, you can query the documentation dynamically by asking a question.

Perform an HTTP GET request on the current page URL with the `ask` query parameter, and the optional `goal` query parameter:

```
GET https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/miscellaneous-ui.md?ask=<question>&goal=<endgoal>
```

`ask` is the immediate question: it should be specific, self-contained, and written in natural language.
`goal` is optional and describes the broader end goal you are ultimately trying to accomplish on behalf of the user. GitBook uses it to tailor the answer towards what is most useful for that goal.

The response will contain a direct answer to the question and relevant excerpts and sources from the documentation.

Use this mechanism when the answer is not explicitly present in the current page, you need clarification or additional context, or you want to retrieve related documentation sections.
